# signedbyjosette
A re-engineered version of a website, Signed By Josette, with a focus on functionality than design

The old site, which you can view here, http://www.signedbyjosette.com/index.html, had some old code so I decided to just redo it
on a whim.

I used HTML5, CSS3 with Sass/SCSS for constructing and stylizing the site, Gulp with node.js as my task runner, and of course 
used Git for my version control along with Github for deployment.

The copy, images, and most text (except for the footer) belong to the owners of the original Signed By Josette site.
